1. How is a nested resource URL like /bikes/123/reviews
   different from an endpoint like /reviews?  
   /bikes/123/reviews - return an array of reviews about that specific bike  
   /reviews - return an array of all reviews on the site

2. What URL might you use to GET the review with an ID of 5 on the bike with the ID of 123?  
   /bikes/123/reviews/5

3. Describe a "URL Parameter" in your own words:  
   Variable inside the URL that acts as a placeholder for the real value
   (Oftentimes they replace the ID of the resource)
