Try to think of a time you used each of the four main methods
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in the real world as you went about
your regular usage of the internet. E.g. today, I checked the
weather on my phone which probably sent a GET request to retrieve
weather information.

GET: Retrieved weather information on my phone

POST: Created a new screencast

PUT: Marked items from my shared todo list as "completed"

DELETE: Deleted a message on Slack that was no longer necessary
